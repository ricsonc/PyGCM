PyGCM
=====

This is a global climate model / general circulation model written in python. It simulates the climate in a three-dimension grid over surface, ocean, and atmosphere of a planet. 

The model takes into account the effects of insolation, radiation, coriolis forces, oceanic and atmopsheric circulation, humidity, weather, vegetation, greenhosue gasses, and ice caps.

This simulation was developed without knowledge of the fluid dynamics required to properly model circulation. Therefore, it is not an accurate simulation of climate.
